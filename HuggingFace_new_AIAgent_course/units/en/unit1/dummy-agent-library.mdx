# Dummy Agent Library

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-unit1sub3DONE.jpg" alt="Unit 1 planning"/>

This course is framework-agnostic because we want to **focus on the concepts of AI agents and avoid getting bogged down in the specifics of a particular framework**. 

Also, we want students to be able to use the concepts they learn in this course in their own projects, using any framework they like.

Therefore, for this Unit 1, we will use a dummy agent library and a simple serverless API to access our LLM engine. 

You probably wouldn't use these in production, but they will serve as a good **starting point for understanding how agents work**. 

After this section, you'll be ready to **create a simple Agent** using `smolagents`

And in the following Units we will also use other AI Agent libraries like `LangGraph`, `LangChain`, and `LlamaIndex`.

To keep things simple we will use a simple Python function as a Tool and Agent. 

We will use built-in Python packages like `datetime` and `os` so that you can try it out in any environment.

You can follow the process [in this notebook](https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/dummy_agent_library.ipynb) and **run the code yourself**.

## Serverless API

In the Hugging Face ecosystem, there is a convenient feature called Serverless API that allows you to easily run inference on many models. There's no installation or deployment required.

```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

## You need a token from https://hf.co/settings/tokens, ensure that you select 'read' as the token type. If you run this on Google Colab, you can set it up in the "settings" tab under "secrets". Make sure to call it "HF_TOKEN"
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"]="hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

client = InferenceClient("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct")
# if the outputs for next cells are wrong, the free model may be overloaded. You can also use this public endpoint that contains Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
# client = InferenceClient("https://jc26mwg228mkj8dw.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud")
```

```python
output = client.text_generation(
    "The capital of France is",
    max_new_tokens=100,
)

print(output)
```
output:
```
Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris.
```
As seen in the LLM section, if we just do decoding, **the model will only stop when it predicts an EOS token**, and this does not happen here because this is a conversational (chat) model and **we didn't apply the chat template it expects**.

If we now add the special tokens related to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct">Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model</a> that we're using, the behavior changes and it now produces the expected EOS.

```python
prompt="""<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
The capital of France is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"""
output = client.text_generation(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=100,
)

print(output)
```
output:
```
The capital of France is Paris.
```

Using the "chat" method is a much more convenient and reliable way to apply chat templates:
```python
output = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "The capital of France is"},
    ],
    stream=False,
    max_tokens=1024,
)
print(output.choices[0].message.content)
```
output:
```
Paris.
```
The chat method is the RECOMMENDED method to use in order to ensure a smooth transition between models, but since this notebook is only educational, we will keep using the "text_generation" method to understand the details.

## Dummy Agent

In the previous sections, we saw that the core of an agent library is to append information in the system prompt.

This system prompt is a bit more complex than the one we saw earlier, but it already contains:

1. **Information about the tools**
2. **Cycle instructions** (Thought → Action → Observation)

```
Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have an `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and an `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are:
get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location, args: {"location": {"type": "string"}}
example use : 

{{
  "action": "get_weather",
  "action_input": {"location": "New York"}
}}

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Only one action at a time in this format:
Action:

$JSON_BLOB (inside markdown cell)

Observation: the result of the action. This Observation is unique, complete, and the source of truth.
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $JSON_BLOB must be formatted as markdown and only use a SINGLE action at a time.)

You must always end your output with the following format:

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Now begin! Reminder to ALWAYS use the exact characters `Final Answer:` when you provide a definitive answer.
```

Since we are running the "text_generation" method, we need to apply the prompt manually:
```python
prompt=f"""<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
{SYSTEM_PROMPT}
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What's the weather in London ?
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
"""
```

We can also do it like this, which is what happens inside the `chat` method :
```python
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in London ?"},
    ]
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct")

tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False,add_generation_prompt=True)
```

The prompt now is :
```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What's the weather in London ?
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

Let's decode!
```python
output = client.text_generation(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=200,
)

print(output)
```
output:

````
Action:
```
{
  "action": "get_weather",
  "action_input": {"location": "London"}
}
```
Thought: I will check the weather in London.
Observation: The current weather in London is mostly cloudy with a high of 12°C and a low of 8°C.
````

Do you see the issue?
>The answer was hallucinated by the model. We need to stop to actually execute the function!
Let's now stop on "Observation" so that we don't hallucinate the actual function response.

```python
output = client.text_generation(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=200,
    stop=["Observation:"] # Let's stop before any actual function is called
)

print(output)
```
output:

````
Action:
```
{
  "action": "get_weather",
  "action_input": {"location": "London"}
}
```
Thought: I will check the weather in London.
Observation:
````

Much Better! 
Let's now create a dummy get weather function.  In a real situation, you would likely call an API.

```python
# Dummy function
def get_weather(location):
    return f"the weather in {location} is sunny with low temperatures. \n"

get_weather('London')
```
output:
```
'the weather in London is sunny with low temperatures. \n'
```

Let's concatenate the base prompt, the completion until function execution and the result of the function as an Observation and resume generation.

```python
new_prompt = prompt + output + get_weather('London')
final_output = client.text_generation(
    new_prompt,
    max_new_tokens=200,
)

print(final_output)
```
Here is the new prompt:
````
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What's the weather in London ?
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Action:
```
{
  "action": "get_weather",
  "action_input": {"location": {"type": "string", "value": "London"}
}
```
Thought: I will check the weather in London.
Observation:the weather in London is sunny with low temperatures. 
````

Output:
```
Final Answer: The weather in London is sunny with low temperatures.
```

We learned how we can create Agents from scratch using Python code, and we **saw just how tedious that process can be**. Fortunately, many Agent libraries simplify this work by handling much of the heavy lifting for you.

Now, we're ready **to create our first real Agent** using the `smolagents` library.
