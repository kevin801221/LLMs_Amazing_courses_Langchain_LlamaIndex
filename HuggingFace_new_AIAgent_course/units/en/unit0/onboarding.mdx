Now that you have all the details, let's get started! We're going to do four things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face Account** if it's not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don't be shy 🤗)
3. **Follow the Hugging Face Agents Course** on the Hub
4. **Spread the word** about the course

### Step 1: Create Your Hugging Face Account

(If you haven't already) create a Hugging Face account <a href='https://huggingface.co/join' target='_blank'>here</a>.

### Step 2: Join Our Discord Community

👉🏻 Join our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/UrrTSsSyjb" target="_blank">here.</a>

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in `#introduce-yourself`.

We have multiple AI Agent-related channels:
- `agents-course-announcements`: for the **latest course information**.
- `🎓-agents-course-general`: for **general discussions and chitchat**.
- `agents-course-questions`: to **ask questions and help your classmates**.
- `agents-course-showcase`: to **show your best agents**.

In addition you can check:

- `smolagents`: for **discussion and support with the library**.

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check [the next section](discord101.mdx).
