# Why use smolagents

In this module, we will explore the pros and cons of using [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index), helping you make an informed decision about whether it's the right framework for your needs.

## What is `smolagents`?

`smolagents` is a simple yet powerful framework for building AI agents. It provides LLMs with the _agency_ to interact with the real world, such as searching or generating images.

As we learned in unit 1, AI agents are programs that use LLMs to generate **'thoughts'** based on **'observations'** to perform **'actions'**. Let's explore how this is implemented in smolagents.

### Key Advantages of `smolagents`
- **Simplicity:** Minimal code complexity and abstractions, to make the framework easy to understand, adopt and extend
- **Flexible LLM Support:** Works with any LLM through integration with Hugging Face tools and external APIs
- **Code-First Approach:** First-class support for Code Agents that write their actions directly in code, removing the need for parsing and simplifying tool calling 
- **HF Hub Integration:** Seamless integration with the Hugging Face Hub, allowing the use of Gradio Spaces as tools

### When to use smolagents?

With these advantages in mind, when should we use smolagents over other frameworks? 

smolagents is ideal when:
- You need a **lightweight and minimal solution.**
- You want to **experiment quickly** without complex configurations.
- Your **application logic is straightforward.**

### Code vs. JSON Actions
Unlike other frameworks where agents write actions in JSON, `smolagents` **focuses on tool calls in code**, simplifying the execution process. This is because there's no need to parse the JSON in order to build code that calls the tools: the output can be executed directly.

The following diagram illustrates this difference:

To review the difference between Code vs JSON Actions, you can revisit [the Actions Section in Unit 1](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/actions#actions-enabling-the-agent-to-engage-with-its-environment).

### Agent Types in `smolagents`

Agents in `smolagents` operate as **multi-step agents**. 

Each [`MultiStepAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.MultiStepAgent) performs:
- One thought
- One tool call and execution

In addition to using **[CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent)** as the primary type of agent, smolagents also supports **[ToolCallingAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent)**, which writes tool calls in JSON.

We will explore each agent type in more detail in the following sections.

<Tip> 
In smolagents, tools are defined using <code>@tool</code> decorator wrapping a python function or the <code>Tool</code> class.

### Model Integration in `smolagents`
`smolagents` supports flexible LLM integration, allowing you to use any callable model that meets [certain criteria](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models). The framework provides several predefined classes to simplify model connections:

- **[TransformersModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.TransformersModel):** Implements a local `transformers` pipeline for seamless integration.
- **[HfApiModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.HfApiModel):** Supports [serverless inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/inference) calls through [Hugging Face's infrastructure](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index), or via a growing number of [third-party inference providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/inference#supported-providers-and-tasks).
- **[LiteLLMModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.LiteLLMModel):** Leverages [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) for lightweight model interactions.
- **[OpenAIServerModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.OpenAIServerModel):** Connects to any service that offers an OpenAI API interface.
- **[AzureOpenAIServerModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.AzureOpenAIServerModel):** Supports integration with any Azure OpenAI deployment.

This flexibility ensures that developers can choose the model and service most suitable for their specific use cases, and allows for easy experimentation.

Now that we understood why and when to use smolagents, let's dive deeper into this powerful library!
