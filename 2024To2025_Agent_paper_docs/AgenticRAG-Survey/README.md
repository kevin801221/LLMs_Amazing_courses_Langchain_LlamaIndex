## Agentic Workflow Patterns: Adaptive Strategies for Dynamic Collaboration

Agentic workflow patterns help structure LLM-based applications to optimize performance, accuracy, and efficiency. Different approaches are suitable depending on task complexity and processing requirements.  
**Source:** [Anthropic Research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) and [LangGraph Workflows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/)

### 1. Prompt Chaining: Enhancing Accuracy Through Sequential Processing
- **Definition:**  
  Prompt chaining decomposes a complex task into multiple steps, where each step builds upon the previous one. This structured approach improves accuracy by simplifying each subtask before moving forward. However, it may increase latency due to sequential processing.
- **When to Use:**  
  This workflow is most effective when a task can be broken down into fixed subtasks, each contributing to the final output. It is particularly useful in scenarios where step-by-step reasoning enhances accuracy.
- **Example Applications:**
  - Generating marketing content in one language and then translating it into another while preserving nuances.
  - Structuring document creation by first generating an outline, verifying its completeness, and then developing the full text.

### 2. Routing: Directing Inputs to Specialized Processes
- **Definition:**  
  Routing involves classifying an input and directing it to an appropriate specialized prompt or process. This method ensures distinct queries or tasks are handled separately, improving efficiency and response quality.
- **When to Use:**  
  Ideal for scenarios where different types of input require distinct handling strategies, ensuring optimized performance for each category.
- **Example Applications:**
  - Directing customer service queries into categories such as technical support, refund requests, or general inquiries.
  - Assigning simple queries to smaller models for cost efficiency, while complex requests go to advanced models.

  <p><em>Figure 2: Illustration of Routing Workflow</em></p>
</div>

---

### 3. Parallelization: Speeding Up Processing Through Concurrent Execution
- **Definition:**  
  Parallelization divides a task into independent processes that run simultaneously, reducing latency and improving throughput. It can be categorized into:
  - **Sectioning:** Splitting tasks into independent subtasks.
  - **Voting:** Generating multiple outputs for increased accuracy.
- **When to Use:**  
  Useful when tasks can be executed independently to enhance speed or when multiple outputs improve confidence.
- **Example Applications:**
  - **Sectioning:** Splitting tasks like content moderation, where one model screens input while another generates a response.
  - **Voting:** Using multiple models to cross-check code for vulnerabilities or analyze content moderation decisions.
  
<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; background-color: white; display: inline-block; text-align: left; margin: 10px; width: 300px;">
  <img src="./assets/parallelization_workflow.png" alt="Parallelization Workflow" style="width: 50%; height: auto; max-height: 200px;">
  <p><em>Figure 3: Illustration of Parallelization Workflow</em></p>
</div>

---

### 4. Orchestrator-Workers: Dynamic Task Delegation
- **Definition:**  
  This workflow features a central orchestrator model that dynamically breaks tasks into subtasks, assigns them to specialized worker models, and compiles the results. Unlike parallelization, it adapts to varying input complexity.
- **When to Use:**  
  Best suited for tasks requiring dynamic decomposition and real-time adaptation, where subtasks are not predefined.
- **Example Applications:**
  - Automatically modifying multiple files in a codebase based on the nature of requested changes.
  - Conducting real-time research by gathering and synthesizing relevant information from multiple sources.
  
<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; background-color: white; display: inline-block; text-align: left; margin: 10px; width: 300px;">
  <img src="./assets/orchestrator_workers_workflow.png" alt="Orchestrator-Workers Workflow" style="width: 50%; height: auto; max-height: 200px;">
  <p><em>Figure 4: Illustration of Orchestrator-Workers Workflow</em></p>
</div>

---

### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer: Refining Output Through Iteration
- **Definition:**  
  The evaluator-optimizer workflow iteratively improves content by generating an initial output and refining it based on feedback from an evaluation model.
- **When to Use:**  
  Effective when iterative refinement significantly enhances response quality, especially when clear evaluation criteria exist.
- **Example Applications:**
  - Improving literary translations through multiple evaluation and refinement cycles.
  - Conducting multi-round research queries where additional iterations refine search results.
  
<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; background-color: white; display: inline-block; text-align: left; margin: 10px; width: 300px;">
