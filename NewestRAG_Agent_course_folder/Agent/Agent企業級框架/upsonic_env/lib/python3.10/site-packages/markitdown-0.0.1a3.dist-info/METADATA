# MarkItDown

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/markitdown.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)

The MarkItDown library is a utility tool for converting various files to Markdown (e.g., for indexing, text analysis, etc.)

It presently supports:

- PDF (.pdf)
- PowerPoint (.pptx)
- Word (.docx)
- Excel (.xlsx)
- Images (EXIF metadata, and OCR)
- Audio (EXIF metadata, and speech transcription)
- HTML (special handling of Wikipedia, etc.)
- Various other text-based formats (csv, json, xml, etc.)
- ZIP (Iterates over contents and converts each file)

# Installation

You can install `markitdown` using pip:

```python
pip install markitdown
```

or from the source

```sh
pip install -e .
```

# Usage
The API is simple:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

markitdown = MarkItDown()
result = markitdown.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content)
```

To use this as a command-line utility, install it and then run it like this:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf
```

This will output Markdown to standard output. You can save it like this:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md
```

You can pipe content to standard input by omitting the argument:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

You can also configure markitdown to use Large Language Models to describe images. To do so you must provide `llm_client` and `llm_model` parameters to MarkItDown object, according to your specific client.


```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model="gpt-4o")
result = md.convert("example.jpg")
print(result.text_content)
```

You can also use the project as Docker Image:

```sh
docker build -t markitdown:latest .
docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md
```
