Schematic Diagram (Figure 1: XC9500 Architecture)**\n\nThe diagram illustrates the architecture of the XC9500 CPLD family. Here's a component-by-component description and their connections:\n\n*   **JTAG Port:**  This is the interface for programming and testing the device. It has 3 connections to the JTAG Controller.\n*   **JTAG Controller:**  Controls the in-system programming process. It is connected to the JTAG Port and the In-System Programming Controller.\n*   **In-System Programming Controller:** Manages the programming of the device. It is connected to the JTAG Controller and the Fast CONNECT II Switch Matrix.\n*   **I/O Blocks:**  These blocks provide the interface between the internal logic and the external pins of the device. There are multiple I/O blocks. They connect to the Fast CONNECT II Switch Matrix. Specific I/O signals are:\n    *   I/O: General purpose I/O pins.\n    *   I/O/GCK: I/O pins with global clock capability (3 connections to I/O Blocks).\n    *   I/O/GSR: I/O pins with global set/reset capability (1 connection to I/O Blocks).\n    *   I/O/GTS: I/O pins with global three-state control (2 or 4 connections to I/O Blocks).\n*   **Fast CONNECT II Switch Matrix:**  A programmable interconnect that allows any function block output to be routed to any other function block input or to any I/O block. It connects to the I/O Blocks, In-System Programming Controller, and Function Blocks.\n*   **Function Blocks (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, ... Block N):**  These blocks contain the programmable logic elements (macrocells). Each block contains 1 to 18 macrocells. Each Function Block has:\n    *   36 connections from the Fast CONNECT II Switch Matrix.\n    *   18 connections to the Fast CONNECT II Switch Matrix.\n\n**2. Function Block Description**\n\n*   Each Function Block contains 18 independent macrocells.\n*   Each macrocell can implement combinatorial or registered functions.\n*   Function Blocks receive global clock, output enable, and set/reset signals.\n*   Each Function Block generates 18 outputs that drive the Fast CONNECT switch matrix.\n*   These 18 outputs and their corresponding output enable signals also drive the IOB (I/O Block).\n*   Logic within the Function Block is implemented using a sum-of-products representation.\n*   36 inputs provide 72 true and complement signals into the programmable AND-array to form 90 product terms.\n*   Up to 90 product terms can be allocated to each macrocell by the product term allocator.\n*   Each Function Block (except for the XC9536) supports local feedback paths.\n*   Local feedback paths allow Function Block outputs to drive into its own programmable AND-array without going outside the Function Block.\n*   These paths are used for creating very fast counters and state machines where all state registers are within the same Function Block.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}
